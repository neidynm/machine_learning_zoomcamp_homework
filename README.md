# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Homework Solutions üöÄ

This repository contains my homework solutions and projects for the **[ML Zoomcamp 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp)** course by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).

## About ML Zoomcamp

ML Zoomcamp is a free 4-month online course focused on the practical aspects of machine learning engineering. The course teaches how to build ML models and deploy them to production, covering everything from fundamental ML concepts to advanced deployment strategies.

## Course Overview

The course covers:
- **Linear Regression** - Feature engineering and regularization techniques
- **Classification** - Logistic regression and feature importance
- **Evaluation Metrics** - Model performance assessment
- **Deployment** - Web services with Flask, Docker containerization
- **Decision Trees & Ensemble Learning** - Random forests, gradient boosting
- **Neural Networks & Deep Learning** - TensorFlow and Keras
- **Serverless Deep Learning** - AWS Lambda deployment
- **Kubernetes & TensorFlow Serving** - Production-grade deployment

## Learning in Public

As part of the "learning in public" approach encouraged by the course, I'm documenting my journey through Medium articles. You can follow my progress and insights here:

### üìñ [ML Zoomcamp 2025 - Medium Reading List](https://medium.com/@neidy.tunzine/list/ml-zoomcamp-2025-7129a148fd20)

Published articles include:
- **Week 2**: Predicting Car Fuel Efficiency with Linear Regression - A deep dive into the fundamentals and CRISP-DM methodology

*More articles coming as I progress through the course!*
